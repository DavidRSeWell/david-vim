# Vim Notes

These are my notes on using vim.

## Temporarily Maximize Pane for Editing

You can use the tab sysem efficiently here,

```shell
:tabedit %
```

Use `gT` to navigate, then

```shell
:tabclose
```

## Terminal

* use Ctrl+\ Ctrl+n to exit terminal mode

## Navigation

`bn` and `bN` will go to next and previous buffer.

`gT` will change tabs.

`g;` will go to place of last edit.

`b` anf `w` will move by word.

## Markdown

I use the markdown-preview.nvim plugin.

`:MarkdownPreview` and it will open a browser.
